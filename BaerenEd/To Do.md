# To Do
-french game at round 8 clicking the correct choice does nothing, clicking the other choices does nothing, it seems stuck and the kid can't proceed. 

-french syllables says /10 at beginning then it is really out of 5 and says 5/5 at end.

-french sentence jumble goes past 10 11/10 and doesn't end the game.

need to display each in pokedex order with spot for most recent at top.
 
-can the page easily display hundres to 2000 images at once? could it lazy load?
